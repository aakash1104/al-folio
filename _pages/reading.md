This page is merely for my own reference to track the books that I have read but
feel free to follow along! For books that are more academically inclined, I'll try to scribe some
notes for future reference. These are in no particular order (maybe relevance)
but below are a list of books that I have read/currently reading.

Books I'm currently reading are italicized. Academic books are highlighted in
