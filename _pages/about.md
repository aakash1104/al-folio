## about ü§î

I am a software engineer at [Flexport](https://flexport.com) where I help build
scalable and performant services that make global trade super easy. Prior to
that, I was at [Intel](https://intel.com) working on performance optimization and
benchmark analytics. Outside of my day job, I spend a lot of time thinking about
DEI and the need for equity in Computer Science education.

I am a proud alum of UC Davis (go ags! üêÆ) where I spent _6 wonderful years_
working on my Masters and Bachelors degree. Currently, I
serve on the
[educational advisory board](https://cs.ucdavis.edu/about/advisory-board) for
the computer science department at UCD.
