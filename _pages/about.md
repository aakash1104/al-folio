## about ü§î

I am a software engineer at [Flexport](https://flexport.com) where I help build
scalable and performant services that make global trade super easy. Prior to
that, I was at [Intel](https://intel.com) working on performance optimization and
benchmark analytics. Outside of my day job, I spend a lot of time thinking about
DEI and the need for equity in Computer Science education.

I am a proud alum of UC Davis (go ags! üêÆ) Currently, I serve on the
[educational advisory board](https://cs.ucdavis.edu/about/advisory-board) for
the computer science department there. Towards the latter half of my time at
Davis, I focused on computing education under
[Joel Porquet-Lupine](https://luplab.cs.ucdavis.edu). I founded a
[seminar](https://cerd.cs.ucdavis.edu) on computing education, co-created an
open source course titled [the missing cs class](https://missing.cs.ucdavis.edu).


#### informal ü•≥

These are just random tidbits about myself:

* I am an ardent fan of tennis, cricket, and soccer.
* Over the weekends, I love to hike and explore the beautiful trails that
California has to offer.
* I love a good cup of [masala chai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masala_chai)
more than anything else
* Sudoku has always fascinated me. Solve some puzzles [here](https://sudoku.com)
